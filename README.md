# TextGameEngine
I'll quickly tell why I made this game engine. If you want to learn more go to Backstory.

I saw somebody making a text game and thought to myself "There must be an easier way to make a text game, right?". I then started making this. It's still a WIP but it will eventually be good.

## Functions

`prompt(options, topDialog, bottomPrompt)`: Currently, it outputs what the user replied.

## TODO
- [ ] Graphics Intergration

- [ ] Add a GUI to make it easier.

- [ ] Extend Functionality by adding Lua Support

## Backstory

I was on a discord server just looking around when I saw somebody using [Replit](replit.com) to make a text game with tk to display images. (Does the whole Graphics Intergration make more sense now?) I thought to myself, "Is there an easier way to make a Text Game?". I never researched it but I wanted to try my hand at a new project and hopefully level up my skills in using library's for python. I want to make 3 versions. one for replit (a template that opens the GUI after done.), one for GUI users, and one for CLI users.

### Explaination for people who don't understand the words im using

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is the front of something. It allows you to use the thing you want to use. where as a Command Line Interface is a text based way of interacting with the app. (I'll get rid of this section later down the line)
